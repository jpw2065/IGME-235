# Proposal

## High Concept

Surf waves while avoiding sea creatures, and rough waves. Trying to survive for as long as possible.
    
## Genre

Avoidance, balancing, survival game.

Universal platform through the browser.
    
## Story

You're at the beach with some bros, and they want to test your surfing skills. So to show them off you try to ride the waves for as long as possible.

## Gameplay

### Mechanics

Player can balance there surfer on the surfboard, while over time it gets harder and harder for the player balance. The player can also use the jump button to jump over water hazards such as sharks. The player can also use the crouch button to dodge hazards that can come from the air.

### Control

The player uses the two buttons (would be on mobile as well) to balance the surfer in either direction. Then there would just be a button for jumping, and a button for crouching.

### Teaching

There would most likely be a very short tutorial the first time the player hits the play button.

### Player Learning

The player mainly just uses the basic controls to play the game fully. But they need to train there reaction time, and hazard patterns to truly master the game.

# Documentation

## Process

My process for the current assignment was to make an HTML page that could be extrapolated very easily to multiple versions of a similar structure/style. I also wanted my CSS to be contained in one file.

## Resources

Stack Overflow, CSS Tricks, W3 Schools, Google.

## Notes

I believe that Mobile viewing could be improved upon, and also color could definitely be improved upon.

## Project Requirements

I believe I have met the project requirements by coming up with a game design and making a game design website using the CRAP principles.
